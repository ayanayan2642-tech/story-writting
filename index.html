          <p>Leo wakes up and immediately checks his phone. Notifications, messages, and videos flood his morning. His

        <div class="text">
          <p>At work, Leo is surrounded by cartoon coworkers, yet he feels alone. Meetings and tasks fill his day, but

          <p>Maya shares stories of small gestures that mattered in her life. Leo understands that commenting online is

          <p>Leo sets rules: no phones during meals, evenings with friends, and Sunday walks for real connection. Small
            steps bring big changes — the moral: <strong>Real connections cannot be charged by a cable; they are built
              with time and care.</strong></p>
